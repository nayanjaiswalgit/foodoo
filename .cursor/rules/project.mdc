# food-delivery monorepo — core rules

## Stack
- **Backend**: Express 4 + TypeScript (CommonJS), Mongoose, Socket.IO, Zod
- **Mobile**: React Native 0.81, Expo 54, expo-router 5, Zustand, React Query
- **Web admin**: React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind v4, Zustand, React Query
- **Shared**: TypeScript-only package consumed as raw source (`workspace:*`)

## Non-negotiable rules
1. Never use `any`. Use `unknown` + type narrowing, or a proper interface.
2. Always import roles, order statuses, and payment types from `@food-delivery/shared`.
3. All backend responses use `sendResponse` or `sendPaginatedResponse` helpers.
4. Services throw `ApiError` — controllers never throw directly.
5. `asyncHandler` wraps every async Express handler — no bare try/catch.

## Shared package is canonical
When a type, enum, or schema needs to exist in more than one package, put it in
`packages/shared/src/` first, then import it everywhere else.
